# GTS_TEST
The entrance exam for Wales University focuses on assessing overall abilities. It involves a two-stage selection process based on the results of the initial examination that covers five subjects: English, Mathematics, Science, Urdu, and Geography/History, each with a maximum score of 100 points. To pass the selection process, applicants must meet the following conditions in both stages.
A total score of 350 points or more in all subjects
Science applicants must have a total score of 160 or higher in two science subjects (mathematics and science)
Humanities applicants must have a total score of 160 or higher in two humanities subjects (Urdu, Geography/History)
Since the score of each subject of each examinee is entered, please find how many people can pass the two-stage selection.
This explanation corresponds to example input 1 in the test.
Examinee 2 has a total of 350 points or more in all subjects, but the total of two humanities subjects is less than 160 points, so the examinee failed. On the other hand, for examinee 4, they have a total of 160 points or more in two science subjects, but their overall total is less than 350 points so they fail the admission test.
